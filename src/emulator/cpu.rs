// src/emulator.rs
/// Every execution cycle, the CPU will fetsch an 8-bit operation code from
/// this memory space. Many of these assembly instructions require an operand
/// to work with, and this operand is indicated by the 1 or 2 bytes immediately
/// following the opcode in memory. Some instruction however do no require any
/// operand and the opcode is sufficient
/// Therefore, instructions have variable lengths and will require 1, 2 or 3
/// bytes of data.

/// When the CPU fetches an opcode, besides decoding the assembly instruction,
/// it will also decode and addressing mode that will determine the number
/// of bytes needed for operands. These addressing modes are described below
